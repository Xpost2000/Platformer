# Platformer
This is a platformer game. My third overall game. My first almost complete game ( technically speaking anyways. )
This is not a good game. But I do these to improve little by little. For some dumb reason I do end up creating a new mini framework
just for one time use. This mini framework actually takes up a week or so ( because I end up making wrappers for OpenGL things instead of using something like some
opengl C++ wrapper ).
## Features?
-Working collision
-Text Rendering
-Pseudo Lighting
-Level Editor
## For myself in a month
Remember to learn to make a game. Not an engine. I construct a framework that is either dysfunctional or
confusing to use or just something that's a one time use. I also suck at getting motivated and as a result
the first few weeks drain most of my motivation and drive to continue. Which is likely why the first month or so
I do very good commits and actually add things. But the last few weeks or second month I usually commit one liners,
and other very minor insignificant things.
