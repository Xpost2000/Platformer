This was also very ambitious too... Oh but I love the work I did on this.

This project I recall putting ALOT of effort in and it shows despite being in-complete.

Infact it is basically a perfectly functional 2D Platformer with a level editor and
something that none of my other games feature. Resolution independence that sort of works.

The level editor was made in a GUI library ( wxWidgets ), and the work I put into it makes
it a very functional what you see is what you get editor, and I'm very very proud of it!

Otherwise it's nothing very special but I did try heavy organization as I recall looking at the
OpenSpades source code to learn how others did things.

My only issue: because I wanted to follow the OpenSpades example, I implemented my graphics to where it
could be extensible, but knowing only OpenGL it was a complete waste of time...
