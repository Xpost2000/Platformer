For future projects of a similar scope.
For godsake please make more organized code, and more flexible
code.

As well as following a more consistent naming style 
(I started with CamalCase and then changed to this camelCase than this_coding_style)
It doesn't help I'm not using an IDE ( going to need to setup all my vim stuff again ).

at least for organization I think I get one point for seperating each thing into it's
own file so it doesn't take forever to track down in the codebase ( although it's pretty small for what it is )( There is a barely any game and it's mostly 90% renderer. )
