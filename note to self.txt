For future projects of a similar scope.
For godsake please make more organized code, and more flexible
code.

As well as following a more consistent naming style 
(I started with CamalCase and then changed to this camelCase than this_coding_style)
It doesn't help I'm not using an IDE ( going to need to setup all my vim stuff again ).

at least for organization I think I get one point for seperating each thing into it's
own file so it doesn't take forever to track down in the codebase ( although it's pretty small for what it is )( There is a barely any game and it's mostly 90% renderer / OpenGL wrapper )

EDIT : I'm seriously starting to regret not learning Component systems ( out of me thinking I wouldn't understand it )
	Also make up my mind on how I want to make the base system setup. Do I want a device styled system like D3D
	or just have entities draw themselves like SDL SFML and everything else

NOTE TO SELF: Add transition screens. I'm actually trying to finish this game.

9/12/17 : From here on. Actually focus on the principle Make the game not the engine. Even if this isn't a bad project( I certainly did new things and learned quite a bit. ) this is the most featureless platformer that can exist and I'm certain with a bit more motivation I could make it much better, like my top down shooter I can always remake this thing with all the features I originally intended..
